# AI Agent Portfolio 

Welcome to my collection of AI Workflow Agents built using MindStudio.  

I am particularly interested in how the overwhelming amount of data to which we have access can be distilled into easily digestible nuggets that keep us informed and, even more importantly, propel us ahead in our endeavours both personally and professionally.  Automation is one thing, careful thinking and prompting is another.  Both are curical to making value add agents.  If you have an idea of something you would like me to work on for you or your organization  I would love to hear from you.  [ðŸ“§ Email me](mailto:alison@alisoncrosthwait.com)
